# Flutter Travel UI
### travel_places_ui

Dark and light theme enabled travel app front end built with Flutter.
 Features Hero page transitions and scrollable listview layouts.

 Inspired by a design from dribbble.

 Building demos like this enlarges my UI component library and I can get a feel for the UX of various scroll and animation features.
